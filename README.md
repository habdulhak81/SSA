### Introduction

### Application

### Method and testing

# Objectives:
This assignment is to demonstrate the interactions between a smart server device (server.py) and client device (client.py). 

A prototype server and client had been created which replicates an Amazon echo controller and smart light client devices. The client device controls turning light switches on and off for each room and sends the information to the server which then knows which rooms have lights switched on or off.

# Language Used: 
Python 2.7???

# Libraries Used: 
Tabulate 
Pickle
Threading
Socket

# Installation
Install server.py and client.py files
Install all libraries required
 
# Run

# Assumptions 

# Security Features 

# Test
